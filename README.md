# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Capstone Project -01

Credit card fraud detection involves the use of sophisticated algorithms and technologies to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions on credit cards. Various methods, such as machine learning, data analytics, and pattern recognition, are employed to analyze transactional data and detect anomalies or suspicious activities in real-time. These systems learn from historical data patterns to spot unusual behaviors, like unexpected transactions, unusual purchase locations, or atypical spending patterns, flagging them for further investigation by financial institutions or cardholders. The aim is to enhance security measures, minimize financial losses, and protect both cardholders and financial institutions from fraudulent activities.
Developed a robust and advanced predictive model for credit card fraud detection, utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. Engineered a comprehensive solution that effectively identifies patterns, anomalies, and suspicious activities within transactional data in real-time. Incorporated feature engineering, ensemble methods, and anomaly detection algorithms to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Implemented rigorous testing and validation procedures, achieving high precision and recall rates, minimizing false positives, and effectively reducing fraudulent transactions. Continuously optimized the model's performance through iterative improvements and adapting to emerging fraud patterns. The predictive model stands as a proactive and reliable defense mechanism, safeguarding financial institutions and customers against evolving fraud threats
